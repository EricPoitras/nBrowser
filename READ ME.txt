At runtime, the database is linked through the Debug folder copy, such as this:

Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\Database.mdf;Integrated Security=True

In the App.Config file, add the following absolute path to the database to ensure it can work in the debug mode:

C:\Users\u0986438\Desktop\nBrowser3.0v2018\nBrowser3.0v2018\nBrowser3.0v2018\Database.mdf
